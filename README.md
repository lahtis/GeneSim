# GeneSim
* genesim - A comprehensive lineage and family relationship simulator. (under development)
* namegen- A simple name simulator that reads first name, middle name, and last name from CVS files. And prints 10 names to the screen. It can choose the middle name with a 50% probability.



Let's try to study if this reflections can ever be done.

The purpose of the program would be to facilitate the development of game design in story based games.

Name generator, ready name lists, random generated names... You can chooce settings what ganerator you use.
 * The most common first names for men in 1860-69 at Finland.
 * The most common middle names for men in 1860-69 at Finland.
 * The most common first names for woman in 1860-69 at Finland.
 * The most common middle names for woman in 1860-69 at Finland.

This based on https://www.tuomas.salste.net/suku/kela-etunimet.html#M1 research. There are a lot of ready-made names. The purpose of this is to initially generate one or more names for use by the program. The lists grow over the years, so the solution needs to be developed. This first list is only 2 names long. This seconds list is only 14 names long. Maybe last list hundreds of thousands names. And Later add middle names and lastnames.
